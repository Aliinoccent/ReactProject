                <p className="text-white p-5" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources, such as data, files, and hardware, with each other. These devices, often referred to as nodes, include computers, servers, routers, and switches, and are linked by wired or wireless connections. The primary purpose of a computer network is to enable communication and collaboration between users and devices, allowing for the efficient transfer of information and resources. Networks can vary in size and complexity, from small local area networks (LANs) within a single building to vast global networks like the Internet, which connects millions of devices across the world. Through the use of protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, networks ensure that data is transmitted securely and accurately, making them essential to modern communication, business operations, and technology infrastructure. </p>
